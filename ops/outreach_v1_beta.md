Hi {Owner Name},

I’m looking for one HVAC partner in {City} to help handle an extra $50k in service calls over the next 90 days.

We’re launching a new growth engine specifically for HVAC shops with 3-10 techs. Since we’re looking for our first 3 "Beta" partners to build a case study, I’m waiving our $2,500 setup fee entirely.

We handle the ads, the lead follow-up, and the review generation. You just show up and do the installs.

If we don't add $50k to your calendar in 90 days, you don't pay us a dime.

Do you have 5 minutes for a brief chat tomorrow?

Best,

[Your Name]
Gruntworks
