**User:** What’s our current state
**AutoBiz:** **Current State: Pre-Revenue / Infrastructure Phase.**

We have a solid offer and a defined ICP, but we are currently at **$0 MRR** with **zero outreach** happening. The bottleneck is the lack of a lead list and a system to manage them. We are "all talk, no action" until those 100 leads are scraped and the first emails are sent.

### Immediate Action Plan:
1.  **Define CRM Structure:** We need a place to track these leads immediately. I'm creating `ops/crm_structure.md`.
2.  **Lead Generation Execution:** I'm drafting the tactical plan to get those 100 leads in `ops/lead_gen_plan.md`.
3.  **Update Project State:** Marking CRM configuration as "In Progress."
