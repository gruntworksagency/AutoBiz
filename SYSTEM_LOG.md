**User:** What’s our current state
**AutoBiz:** **Current State: Pre-Revenue / Infrastructure Phase.**

We have a solid offer and a defined ICP, but we are currently at **$0 MRR** with **zero outreach** happening. The bottleneck is the lack of a lead list and a system to manage them. We are "all talk, no action" until those 100 leads are scraped and the first emails are sent.

### Immediate Action Plan:
1.  **Define CRM Structure:** We need a place to track these leads immediately. I'm creating `ops/crm_structure.md`.
2.  **Lead Generation Execution:** I'm drafting the tactical plan to get those 100 leads in `ops/lead_gen_plan.md`.
3.  **Update Project State:** Marking CRM configuration as "In Progress."

**User:** Where are we at and what’s next?
**AutoBiz:** **Status Report:**
We are at **Ground Zero**. MRR is $0. The foundation (Offer, ICP, CRM Structure) is built. The bottleneck is **Lead Data**. We cannot launch outreach without a target list.

**Immediate Objective:** Finalize the CRM container and move to active scraping.

### Actions Taken:

1.  **Finalized CRM Container:** Created `ops/crm_master.csv` to serve as our primary lead database.
2.  **Refined Outreach Strategy:** Created a high-urgency "Beta" script specifically designed to close the first 3 clients by leveraging the "Setup Fee Waiver" mentioned in `THE_OFFER.md`.
